# Production Deployment Workflow
# This workflow runs when code is pushed to the main branch (production)
# It runs tests and checks for schema changes
# IMPORTANT: Schema changes are NOT automatically applied to production for safety
# You must manually run migrations before merging to main

name: Production - Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Only triggers on pushes to main (production) branch

jobs:

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the latest code from main branch
      - name: Checkout repository

          fetch-depth: 2  # Fetch last 2 commits so we can compare for schema changes

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run tests against production database
      # These should be read-only tests or tests against a production-like test database
