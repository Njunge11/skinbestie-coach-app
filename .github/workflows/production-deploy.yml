# Production Deployment Workflow
# This workflow runs when code is pushed to the main branch (production)
# It runs tests, applies migrations to PlanetScale, then Vercel deploys automatically

name: Production - Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Only triggers on pushes to main (production) branch

jobs:
  deploy-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the latest code from main branch
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js with npm caching
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run tests against production database
      # Validates that code works before applying any schema changes
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:run
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PLANETSCALE_POSTGRES_URL }}

      # Step 5: Apply database migrations to PlanetScale production
      # Runs migration SQL files that were generated locally with db:generate
      # These migrations are version-controlled and reviewable before deployment
      # Provides audit trail and rollback capability for production changes
      - name: Apply database migrations to production
        run: npm run db:migrate
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PLANETSCALE_POSTGRES_URL }}

      # Step 6: Log deployment success
      # Vercel handles the actual deployment to admin.skinbestie.co automatically
      # This workflow validates the code and updates the database before deployment
      - name: Notify deployment
        if: success()
        run: |
          echo "✅ Production checks passed and database schema applied"
          echo "🚀 Vercel will deploy to: https://admin.skinbestie.co"
