# Staging Deployment Workflow
# This workflow runs when code is pushed to the staging branch
# It runs tests, applies migrations to Supabase, then Vercel deploys automatically

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the latest code from staging branch
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js with npm caching
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run tests against staging database
      # Validates that code works before applying any schema changes
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:run
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL }}

      # Step 5: Apply database migrations to Supabase staging
      # Runs migration SQL files that were generated locally with db:generate
      # These migrations are version-controlled and reviewable before deployment
      - name: Apply database migrations to staging
        run: npm run db:migrate
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL }}

      # Step 6: Log deployment success
      # Vercel handles the actual deployment to staging.admin.skinbestie.co automatically
      # This workflow validates the code and updates the database before deployment

          echo "✅ Staging checks passed and database schema applied"
