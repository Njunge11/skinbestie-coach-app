# Staging Deployment Workflow
# This workflow runs whenever code is pushed to the staging branch
# It applies schema changes, refreshes test data, and runs tests
# Vercel automatically deploys to staging-admin.skinbestie.co after this workflow succeeds

name: Staging - Deploy and Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - staging  # Only triggers when code is pushed to staging branch

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the latest code from staging branch
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js with npm caching
      # Caching speeds up subsequent workflow runs by reusing node_modules
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # Uses npm ci for clean, reproducible installs from package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Apply database schema changes to staging
      # Drizzle push compares your schema code with the actual database
      # and updates tables/columns/indexes to match
      # This updates the Supabase staging database (public schema)
      # Note: Uses Session Pooler (port 5432) which supports prepared statements
      - name: Apply database schema to staging
        run: npm run db:push
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL }}

      # Step 5: Refresh staging test data
      # Re-seeds the database with fresh test data
      # This ensures staging always has consistent, known test data for QA
      - name: Seed staging database
        run: npx tsx src/scripts/seed-profiles.ts
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL }}

      # Step 6: Run all tests against staging database
      # Validates that all features work correctly before Vercel deploys
      # If tests fail, you know there's an issue before it reaches staging URL
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:run
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL }}

      # Step 7: Log success message
      # Note: Vercel handles the actual deployment to staging-admin.skinbestie.co
      # This workflow just prepares the database and validates the code
      - name: Notify deployment
        if: success()
        run: |
          echo "✅ Staging deployment successful: https://staging-admin.skinbestie.co"
